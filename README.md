NLSR - Named Data Link State Routing Protocol
=============================================

## Overview

NLSR is a routing protocol in NDN that populates NDN's Forwarding Information Base. NLSR
will continue to evolve alongside the Named Data Networking [protocol](http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-tlv/).

NLSR is an open and free software package licensed under the GPL 3.0 (or later) license and free to all
Internet users and developers.  For more information about the licensing details and
limitations, refer to [COPYING.md](https://github.com/named-data/NLSR/blob/master/COPYING.md).

NLSR is developed by the members of the [NSF-sponsored NDN project team](http://named-data.net/project/participants/).
For more details, please refer to [AUTHORS.md](https://github.com/named-data/NLSR/blob/master/AUTHORS.md).
Bug reports and feedback are highly appreciated and can be made through the
[Redmine site](http://redmine.named-data.net/projects/nlsr).

The main design goal of NLSR is to provide a routing protocol to populate NDN's FIB.
NLSR calculates the routing table using link-state or hyperbolic routing and produces
multiple faces for each reachable name prefix in a single authoritative domain. NLSR
will continue to evolve over time to include neighbor discovery and to become a full
fledged inter-domain routing protocol for NDN.
